Copied by elm-init from the default projects

## Usage

**Parcel is (temporarily) not working because [parcel-plugin-elm](https://github.com/ssuman/parcel-plugin-elm/blob/master/ElmAsset.js) does not work with elm 0.19, because [node-elm-compiler](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-elm-compiler/pull/72) does not work with elm 0.19 yet. Until it is fixed `npm start` just runs `elm reactor`**

Start [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) using `npm start`. All the files in [./src/](./src/) compile to [./dist/](./run/).

```
npm start
```
